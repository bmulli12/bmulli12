## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Braden Mullis and I am a current senior at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am majoring in Computer Science with a concetration in Data Science. I am set to graduate in December of 2024 with my Bachelor's Degree. I am passionate about coding and learning new coding languages. 

## Projects I've worked on ðŸ”­

Over the course of my 3 years at Charlotte I have worked on several projects in different courses with many different langauges. The most recent project I worked on was a personal nutrition and fitness app where users can track their calories and keep track of their workouts within their life. They can even add new foods to the database if their are specific foods that havent been seen or included before. There is also a personal profile page where users can add things like what they are trying to achieve with using the app and their basic information like name, email, age, and weight. We also deployed it to the cloud with a working link. 

## Goals and Objective ðŸŒ±

My goals and objectives for this semester is finish my last semester strong with a good knowledge and understanding of all I have learned throughout my time at Charlotte and put that knowledge towards finding a job. I want to work hard on my Capstone project so that I can include it for my resume on projects I have worked on. I am hoping for a great final semester that will allow me to grow and become a better student as well as give me the skills needed to obtain job interests from high-end companies.
